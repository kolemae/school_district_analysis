## Overview of Project
I was tasked with assisting Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a city school district, with analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. We aggregated data and showcased trends in school performance to assist the school board and superintendent with budgeting and prioritization within the district. For this project we:
- Created a development environment that runs Python 3.7
- Cleaned student names to match district records
- Replaced Thomas High School's 9th grade results with NaN's
- Created a district summary DataFrame
- Created a school summary DataFrame
- Determined the top 5 performing schools, based on overall passing rate
- Determined the bottom 5 performing schools, based on overall passing rate
- Calculated the average math score for each grade level from each school
- Calculated the average reading score for each grade level from each school
- Organized the scores by school spending per student
- Organized the scores by school size
- Organized the scores by school type

### Resources
- Data source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Anaconda 2021.11, Python 3.7.11, Jupyter Notebook
